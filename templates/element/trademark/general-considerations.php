		<?= __('A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of words, phrases, symbols or designs, that
		identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. A service mark is the
		same as a trademark, except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product.
		"Trade dress" or "get up" refers to the look and feel of the packaging, which in this context can include the
		layout, colors, images, and design choices in a web page. Throughout this Policy, the terms "trademark" and
		"mark" refer to both trademarks, service marks and trade dress.')?>

		<strong id="considerations-confusion" class="pt-20"><?= __('What is "likelihood of confusion"?')?></strong><br>
		<?= __('There is trademark infringement if your use of a trademark has created a "likelihood of confusion." This means
		using a trademark in a way that will likely confuse or deceive the relevant consuming public about the source of
		a product or service using the mark in question. For example, if the "Foo" software extension removes all double
		spaces after periods, but someone else later creates "Foo" software that adds a third space after periods,
		consumers would be confused between the two and the newcomer will likely be a trademark infringer. As another
		example, if a company makes "Foobar" software and a third party offers training called "Foobar Certification," a
		person is likely to believe, wrongly, that the certification is being offered by the makers of Foobar software.
		The third party has likely misled consumers about the source of its training and is a trademark infringer.')?>

		laws also have similar provisions. For example, a car repair shop that specializes in a particular brand of
		automobile, VW for example, must be allowed to say that they repair VW cars. Here is what you should consider
