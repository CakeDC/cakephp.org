		associated goods and services and continue to embody the high reputation of the software and the community
		associated with it. This Policy therefore tries to strike the proper balance between: 1) our need to ensure
		that our trademarks remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they are meant to preserve and 2) our
		community members\' desire to be full participants in the Project. ') ?></p>
