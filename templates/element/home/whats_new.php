                <h2>What's new in V.4</h2>
                <p>CakePHP 4.0.0 is as tasty as other major CakePHP releases but will now require you to use
                    PHP 7.2.
                    With a refreshed application skeleton design, CakePHP 4.0.0 comes with a streamlined API
                    making your
                    development and application faster.</p>
                <p>While 4.0 contains a number of breaking changes we have prepared an exhaustive migration
                    guide
                    covering all the deprecated and removed features as well as highlighting the shiny new
                    features.</p>
